"""Create a rater account, or an ingest account, with an issued password.

Raters get an ordinary, non-staff account and a password generated here; they
never choose one and never reset one, which is why dirt/urls.py routes no
password_change or password_reset view. The generated password is stronger
than a chosen one and there is no unauthenticated reset endpoint to attack —
the cost is that the password travels over whatever channel you send it on,
and only you can rotate it (`--reset`).

`--ingest` makes the same kind of account and adds it to the `ingest` group,
which is what `manage push` authenticates as. A group rather than `is_staff`,
which would additionally open /admin/, and rather than a bespoke token, which
would have bypassed django-axes: an ingest password that goes through
django.contrib.auth is throttled by the same lockout as any other login.
Revoke one by taking the account out of the group, or by deactivating it.
