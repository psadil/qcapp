"""Review-ordering strategies — how the next image to review is chosen.

Each strategy encapsulates its own ``order_by`` on a per-step ``Image``
queryset and self-registers by its :class:`~models.ReviewStrategy` key (the same
registry idiom the ingest ``StepSpec`` uses, but class-based via
``__init_subclass__``; cf. Effective Python, "Register Class Existence with
``__init_subclass__``"). Adding a strategy is a new subclass — nothing else changes.

Why breadth-first is the backbone. Submitting a review is what advances the queue:
it increments ``Image.n_reviews`` so a reviewed image sinks. ``priority`` is static
(reviewing never changes it), so it can only ever *re-rank within* a review-depth
band — never be the primary key — or the reviewer would ping-pong between the two
worst images forever. On the first pass (everything at ``n_reviews == 0``) the whole
step is ordered worst-first; then it naturally deepens.
