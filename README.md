# DIRT

**DIRT** (the Derived Imaging Review Tool) is a web application for quality
control (QC) of neuroimaging derivatives at the scale of large consortia. It
was built for the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) project, which is
collecting scans from more than 2,800 participants.

📖 **Full documentation:** <https://psadil.github.io/dirt/> — including a
[quickstart](https://psadil.github.io/dirt/getting-started/quickstart.html) and a
walkthrough for [reviewing your own dataset](https://psadil.github.io/dirt/tutorials/review-local-dataset.html).

## Why

Neuroimaging preprocessing pipelines fail on some fraction of scans. At
consortium scale, even a low failure rate means hundreds of affected scans, and
automated failure detection is not yet reliable enough to replace human
inspection — but manual QC is hard to carry out at that scale. DIRT exists to
make thorough manual review fast enough to keep up.

## How it works

DIRT has three parts:

- **Image generation.** Given a preprocessed dataset in
  [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) layout, DIRT uses the BIDS metadata to
  locate derivatives and render a compact set of QC images for each one — for a
  brain mask, for example, five informative slices in each of three
  orientations. Where a failure is best seen across a whole volume, the image is
  animated.
- **Quantitative measures.** Every derivative DIRT renders is also measured —
  brain-mask volume, how much of the brain the field of view cuts off, which
  tissue it cuts through, how far a coregistration moves the brain. Every metric
  DIRT can compute from a file is computed and stored, whether or not anything
  orders by it, and no metric is ever shown to a rater.
- **A review-ordering algorithm.** During a session, images are served one at a
  time. The default *breadth-first* strategy takes the next image from whichever
  scan has been reviewed the fewest times, so effort spreads across the whole
  dataset first and deepens per scan as time allows. *anomaly-first* keeps that
  backbone but re-ranks within each review-depth band by how atypical a measure
  is, surfacing likely failures early without ever hiding anything.
- **A review platform.** A mobile-friendly Django web app presents the images,
  collects ratings, and stores everything in a SQL database, so several
  reviewers can work on the same dataset at once. A little session metadata (who
  reviewed, and when) is recorded alongside each rating.

### Two kinds of review

Each derivative is reviewed with whichever interaction best matches how it tends
to fail:

- **Click to mark a location** — for problems that show up in a specific spot (a
  mask that includes skull, a cortical surface that strays into gray matter).
  The reviewer clicks directly on each problem area, producing a set of
  coordinates per image; more clicks generally means lower quality, and the
  marked locations can hint at which parts of a derivative remain usable. Used
  for **brain masks**, **spatial normalization**, and **surface localization**.
- **Rate the whole image** — for problems that are not tied to one location (a
  globally noisy tensor-fit map, a coregistration that failed to align two
  images). The reviewer chooses **pass**, **unsure**, or **fail** (scored 0 / 1
  / 2); a single *fail* can be enough to exclude a derivative. Used for
  **field-map coregistration** and **diffusion tensor fitting**.

DIRT is deliberately easy to stand up. It can run on cloud infrastructure, but
it also runs as a single container on one machine — a laptop, a shared lab
workstation, or a cluster login node — storing images and ratings in a local
SQLite database that needs no separate database server. That keeps
the barrier to entry low for teams without dedicated web-backend resources. It
is in production on A2CPS Release 2.0 (~29 TB across ~2.2 million derivative
files).

## Running

The following assumes a file `.env` providing at least `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, and
optionally `DB` (the path to the SQLite database file; defaults to
`db/dirt.db`). See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full list of variables.

The database and its WAL sidecar files live in a `db/` directory that must be
mounted as a volume so data survives the container:

```shell
docker run \
  --rm \
  -it \
  -v ${PWD}/db:/app/db \
  --env-file=.env \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  psadil/dirt
```

If all goes well, the container migrates the database, creates the cache table,
starts a Celery worker, and serves the app with granian:

```shell
Performing system checks...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
[INFO] Starting granian (dirt.asgi:application)
[INFO] Listening at http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

You should now be able to navigate to the app on a browser on your local machine: `http://localhost:8000`.

Select a processing step, and go rate! The ratings are saved as you go along, so you can exit at any time.

## Development Setup

For local testing and development, you can use the provided setup script to
automatically download a small sample dataset (from OpenNeuro `ds007070`),
create a database, and generate quality control images.

1. Run the setup script from the project root:
   ```shell
   pixi run devsetup
   ```
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```shell
   docker buildx build -t psadil/dirt --platform=linux/amd64 --provenance=true .
   ```
3. Run the development server via Docker (using your newly populated local database):
   ```shell
   docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/db:/app/db --env-file=.env.docker -p 8000:8000 psadil/dirt
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You can log into the admin interface (`/admin`) using the username `admin` and password `admin`.

## Deployment notes

DIRT runs the database and the cache on SQLite in a single container, following
[the alldjango guide to SQLite in production](https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production).
The database connection uses WAL journaling and `IMMEDIATE` transactions so the
web workers can share the one file. Because the whole state is a directory of
files, back it up (or replicate it, e.g. with Litestream) by copying the mounted
`db/` volume.

## Tips

### sqlite3

The dev database is a SQLite file at `db/dirt.db`.

#### Check tables

```shell
$ sqlite3 db/dirt.db .tables
auth_group                          django_dirt_ratings_annotation
auth_group_permissions              django_dirt_ratings_annotationcell
auth_permission                     django_dirt_ratings_image
auth_user                           django_dirt_ratings_rating
auth_user_groups                    django_dirt_ratings_session
auth_user_user_permissions          django_migrations
django_admin_log                    django_session
django_content_type                 ...
```

#### Look through some basic ratings

```shell
$ sqlite3 -header db/dirt.db "SELECT id, rating, source_data_issue, created_at, session_id, image_id FROM django_dirt_ratings_rating LIMIT 10;"
```

#### Look through location annotations

Click-to-mark reviews are stored as a grid: each `django_dirt_ratings_annotation`
row records the grid it used (`grid_cols`, `grid_rows`) for one image/session, and
each marked cell is a `django_dirt_ratings_annotationcell` row (`col`, `row`,
`rating`, where `rating` is 1 = unsure or 2 = fail; unmarked cells are an implied
pass). Join the two to read the marked cells back out:

```shell
$ sqlite3 -header db/dirt.db "SELECT c.col, c.row, c.rating, a.grid_cols, a.grid_rows, a.image_id, a.session_id FROM django_dirt_ratings_annotationcell c JOIN django_dirt_ratings_annotation a ON a.id = c.annotation_id LIMIT 10;"
```

#### Get Ratings and Metadata

```shell
$ sqlite3 -header db/dirt.db "SELECT rating, file1 FROM django_dirt_ratings_rating LEFT JOIN django_dirt_ratings_image ON django_dirt_ratings_rating.image_id = django_dirt_ratings_image.id LIMIT 20;"
```

## Build

Both images build from the single `Dockerfile`, selected by the `ENVIRONMENT`
build argument (default = the web app):

```shell
# web app
docker build -t psadil/dirt:prod --provenance=true --platform=linux/amd64 .

# image-generation CLI (manage environment; also ships the bidslake indexer)
docker build --build-arg ENVIRONMENT=manage -t psadil/dirt:manage \
  --provenance=true --platform=linux/amd64 .
```

Note that we're not pushing this to dockerhub. Everything will be run locally.
